Current local connectome visualisations for connectionTypesDerivedFromEMimages/connectionTypesDerivedFromPresynapticNeurons include:

- connections_IE.svg (connections_IE_Lx.svg) - connections coloured by excitatory/inhibitory type and pre/post synaptic direction; neurons colours by cell type.
- connections_IE_layered.svg (connections_IE_layeredLx.svg) - neurons/connections coloured by layer.
- connections_IE_flow.svg (connections_IE_flow_Lx.svg) - connections coloured by excitatory/inhibitory type and flow direction (through the cortical layers); neurons colours by cell type.
- connections_IE_flowIO.svg (connections_IE_flowIO_Lx.svg) - connections coloured by excitatory/inhibitory type, pre/post synaptic direction, and flow direction (through the cortical layers); neurons colours by cell type.

The colour sets can be modified/customised within the svg file <"linearGradient"> tags.
